# Roadmap

## Document Purpose

This document is the execution plan for the Friendly Neighborhood Server Monitor project.

Unlike the other project documentation, this file is expected to change frequently as the project evolves.

Its primary audience is **AI development assistants**.

An AI should be able to read this document, determine the current state of the project, implement the next logical piece of work, update this document, and stop.

The project should always remain in a functional state after completing any task.

# How To Use This Document

## For Human Contributors

* Review and adjust priorities as the project evolves.
* Mark completed work.
* Add new tasks when necessary.
* Keep this document synchronized with the repository.

## For AI Contributors

Unless explicitly instructed otherwise:

1. Read `architecture.md`.
2. Read `ui_style.md`.
3. Read `api.md`.
4. Read the documentation referenced by the current task.
5. Implement **one task only**.
6. Update documentation if required.
7. Mark the completed task.
8. Stop.

Do not begin the next task unless requested.

# Task Status

Use the following status values.

# Effort Estimates

Effort estimates are intentionally approximate.

| Size | Description                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| XS   | Less than one short AI session             |
| S    | One normal AI session                      |
| M    | Multiple AI sessions                       |
| L    | Large feature requiring several iterations |

If a task becomes too large, it should be divided into additional implementation tasks.
